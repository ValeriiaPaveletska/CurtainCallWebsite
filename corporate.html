			<p class="corp">Brand persona</p>
			<img src="images/brandpersona.png" width="500" alt="Brand Persona">
			<p class="corp">Based on our research on the target audience, we’ve created two personas – a boy and a girl, so meet Merel and Frank!</p>
<p class="corp">Frank is 28 years old; he lives in The Netherlands and works as a creative DTP. He lives with his girlfriends and has a middle income. Frank is outgoing and loves listening to music and exploring new fun activities. Theater is his passion, and he even considers it when going on vacation – he checks the local theaters when travelling. His hobbies include going to the gym with friends and volunteering at various events. He loves spending time in nature taking professional pictures but also hiking, which he wants to do more often. Frank mainly uses Instagram, TikTok and Facebook around 5 hours a day, while chatting with friends and talking on Facetime.</p> 

<p class="corp">His future goals are concentrated on his job – getting a manager’s position at the company he is currently working in, having a stable income and maybe one day opening his own company. Frank struggles with connecting with new people and has a challenge finding friends to go to the theater with. His theater interests include mainly comedy plays and stand-up comedy but also performances with meaningful stories.</p>  

<p class="corp">Merel has a similar lifestyle to Frank – she is 24 years old, living in the Netherlands and working as a communications officer at a cultural center with an average income. She is sociable and spontaneous but appreciates my time. In her free time, she enjoys art and going to the theater and live music performances. Merel finds peace in reading books and crocheting.  She loves travelling to some cultural destinations such as Vienna, Rome and Venice.  Her preferred method of communication is calling on the phone, and she uses Instagram and TikTok most around 6 hours a day (mostly after work).</p>

<p class="corp">Her goals include to be promoted at work and build a stable income which she will use to travel more, explore and visit new cultural performances such as theater plays. For Merel, it is a challenge to maintain a good work-life balance. When she does though, she loves watching contemporary theater and musicals as well as she is curious to try out experimental art performances. </p>
			<p class="corp"> Brand Visual Identity</p>
			<p class="corp"> The name of the app is Curtain Call. The logo exudes connection and, of course, theater. The masks in the logo are a symbol for theater. The emphasis here is on the smiling mask that exudes fun. The shape of the logo is a chat icon which refers to the important aspect of our app, which is chatting with other users. With this we emphasize that Curtain Call is not only about the performances, but also about the people you meet through it. The colors feature the classic red color of theater curtains combined with a blue color that symbolizes reliability. The logo text consists of Algerian font, a decorative serif font that evokes a sense of drama and fits perfectly with the theater theme.</p>
			<img src="images/visualidentity.png" width="500" alt="Visual Identity">
			<p class="corp"> Supporting Visuals</p>
			<p class="corp"> All supporting visuals, including colors, typography, icons and images, are connected to the brand's vision: to create connection, excitement and shared experiences around theater. The design choices reflect the emotional tone of the brand – accessible, humorous, playful and relatable. We have used various self-made visual or non-copy right photos but also photos and videos which we have filmed ourselves. We’ve created the initial fonts and color palette but further in the process decided that this won’t be fitted for our social media platforms, therefore we have changed our font package with a few new options. The color palette was also adapted to the stickers that we were using in the template (for instance, the curtains). </p>

          <p class="corp">Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>

              <ul class="list-unstyled">

                  #871719
                  <em class="corp">The red colour refers to the classic colour of the red theatre curtains and velvet chairs, which fits with our value "The old smell of velvet seats". We want our colour pallette to have a clear association with our brand image.</em>
                </li>
                <li class="corp">
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #0F2347;"></span>
                  #0F2347
                  <em>Dark blue signifies reliability. It pairs well with gold and dark red, creating a rich contrast that reminds our users of old theatres and classical plays.</em>
					<li class="corp">
                  <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #EEBF1B;"></span>
                  #EEBF1B
                  <em>Gold signifies richness and the stage spotlight. Not only do we want our users to associate our brand with theatre spotlights, but we also want to put our users on the spotlight and show them their importance in our brand.</em>
				  </li>
                </li>
              </ul>
			<p class="corp"> Process visual development</p>
			<p class="corp"> We wanted to recreate the premium feeling that theater delivers. We started by creating a mood board and adding all type of theater-related images to it in order to convey the upscale experience of the theater itself. This helped us identify the main distinguishing marks. We found out that a lot of people connect the colors red and gold to the theater hall. Also some signature symbols associated with it are the two masks and the curtains on stage, therefore we decided to incorporate them. The color palette consisted of yellow, red and blue. Using two shades of red, one of them burgundy, stands for passion and emotion, key traits of theater. The two shades of yellow, one of them suggesting gold, represent prestige and recognition. The dark blue was used as a base color which will contrast them. Giving depth and sense of sophistication, it is also going hand in hand with the burgundy, therefore it was the perfect match. For the logo itself at first, we had a few ideas quite different from one another. In the end version we added the “message bubble”, corresponding with the features of our app – a place where people meet and connect through texting. The “comedy and tragedy” masks as a classic symbol of the theater, representing the emotional range of drama - from joy till sorrow, are immediately communicating that the brand is connected to performing arts. The naming process was also challenging starting with a few suggestions such as “Theater match” or “Theater swipe”, hinting the actual functions of the app. The final choice – “Curtain Call” was decided to be something playful, giving the feeling that theater is “calling" its lovers who cherish it deeply. Adding a mysterious touch, the “theater” in the name was replaced with one of its symbols – the curtains. </p>
			
            <li class="corp">Font choices: The logo text consists of Algerian font, a decorative serif font that evokes a sense of drama and fits perfectly with the theater theme. For titles on the website we chose Cormorant Unicase, because of its elegant touch that sophistication to our website, while maintaining readability. It creates a clear typographic hierarchy. For the supporting text, we use Futura, a clean and clear neutral font that creates a nice contrast. This font is regularly used for apps and websites and makes the text easy and clear to read. The combination of Cormorant Unicase for headings and Futura for body text makes our website look both theatrical and professional. </li>
            <li class="corp">Home page: The home page starts with a carousel which has direct links to three important pages. The pictures in the carousel preview the content of the pages without the need to open them to understand, making it easier for the user to navigate the website based on their needs. The pictures were chosen to support our brand image, with most of them being connected to theatre. If the user scrolls down, they can read the description of the product, as well as our values, vision and mission. All of these elements have icons above them that correspond to the content piece, for easier understanding and assosiation. A little bit further the user can find pictures of Curtain Call TikTok and Instagram page. Both of the images are clickable with links attached to them, making it easy to navigate. You can notice a consistent colour-scheme throughtout the page, with red and blue gradient background paired contrasting gold icons.</li>
		   <li class="corp">Download page: This page is accessible from the navigation bar as well as from the carousel on the main page and the bottom of "Our plays" page. We use a Hero banner to create a call to action to download the app. A little further down the user can read the description of how the app works and view the images of how the app looks.</li>
		  <li class="corp">Our plays page: This page is accessible from the navigation bar as well as from the carousel on the main page. We use a different cards to showcase the plays available on our app. All cards have a "buy tickets" option, but if the user wants to get more plays they can only do it in the app. There is a call to action button at the bottom of the page that leads the user back to the download page.</li>

          <ul>
			  <li class="corp"> Goals </li> 
<p class="corp"> The goal of our testing was to find out whether the website is intuitive and easy to navigate without clear directions. The user has to be able to tell what the website is about and what we advertise. Messaging should be clear and understandable, and the user should be able to accomplish key tasks - such as finding information about our app, downloading it, buying tickets to a play or contacting support without any friction or confusion.</p>

<p class="corp">To achieve our goal we conducted a series of usability tests. All our testers were a part of our target demographic. All our testers were young adults, 22-24 years old, theatre lovers. We had 3 participants. Each participant was given a few different tasks so that we could observe how they interacted with the website when given minimal guidance. </p> 

<li class="corp"> Test setting </li>

<p class="corp"> All tests were conducted in a casual setting, in a shared living room of a dorm apartment building on a laptop device. The participants were made comfortable, no pressure was put on them during the testing.</p> 

<li class="corp">Testing protocol</li>

<p class="corp"> Participants were given three different tasks and were instructed to voice their thoughts as they navigate the website. The testing was video, and audio recorded from the back of the participants, with the screen visible. After each testing session participants were asked whether the website is easy to follow and if the design felt intuitive.</p> 

<li class="corp"> Findings</li>
<p class="corp"> Positive findings</p>
<p class="corp"> 1. The website is clear and easy to follow – all participants agreed that the website design is intuitive and understandable. </p> 

<p class="corp">2. The download button is the easiest to find – none of the participants had difficulties with downloading the app. Considering that the main goal of our website is to get people to download our app, this is a successful finding.</p>

			  <p class="corp"> Negative findings: </p> 

<p class="corp"> 1. When buying tickets, most users would succeed in finding the link and following it to an external source, but all of them had trouble with going back to Curtain Call website. The users would get confused and start looking through the external website to get back on the Curtain Call page. </p> 

<p class="corp"> 2. The links at the bottom of the website did not lead to the actual Social media accounts of the brand, and half of them were not applicable due to our brand's limited social media pages. </p> 

<p class="corp"> 3. None of the users paid much attention to the carousel on the Home page. Most of them would scroll all the way down the Home page, then would go back and look at the navigation bar instead. </p> 

<p class="corp"> 4. The values order is not clear on the website. When asked to find the third value, all the participants would point at the fourth value instead. </p> 

			  <li class="corp"> Suggested improvements </li>
<p class="corp"> Create a pop-up window that informs the user that they will be leaving the website when clicking on the “buy tickets” button. This is very hard to implement due to the time constraints. We did, however, put a disclaimer on the top of the “Our Plays” page that all of the links would lead the user to an external source. Therefore we hope to avoid further confusing when navigating the website during the purchase process. </p>

<p class="corp"> The links at the bottom of the website should be changed to lead to the actual social media accounts of the brand. This suggestion was implemented. </p>

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="corp" style="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
		 <p class="corp">Curtain Call is a new and interesting platform created to bring people together through a shared love for theater. The app is inspired by swipe-based apps like Tinder. Our brand provides a new way to discover theater by making it interactive and community driven.With Curtain Call, users can swipe through upcoming theater performances based on their interests and preferences. Once a play catches their attention, they can like the play by clicking on a heart button and are given the option to be added to a group chat with other users who are also interested in attending this play. These chats spur users into interesting conversations before and after the performance, and they even get the chance to buy tickets through the app and go to a play together. If you don't want to join a group chat right away yet, you can always do so afterwards by going to your “liked plays” page. Curtain Call is not only about finding plays, but also about finding people to enjoy theater together. Our brand is about connection, community and discovery. We believe theater is more powerful when shared, and our goal is to make theater more accessible and fun by bringing people together.</p>
          <p class="corp">Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the Communication and Media Plan.</p>
		 <p class="corp">To promote Curtain Call, we focused on creating relatable, shareable and fun content that resonates with our target audience: young adults and culture enthusiasts who love theater but may not always have someone to go with. Our campaign included:</p>
<p class="corp">TikToks reels We primarily used trending sounds. In TikTok, videos are viewed more often as a result. We also posted humoristic and relatable scenarios (e.g., “Pov: you impulsively bought theater tickets once again”) to increase engagement.</p>
<p class="corp">Instagram carousels Showcasing informative posts on Curtain Call such as fun facts and an insight of our brand. But also, a humoristic and relatable posts, to make clear what our brand is about.</p> 
		<p class="corp">Instagram reels Humoristic and relatable scenarios to engage with our followers.</p>
<p class="corp"> Instagram stories Mainly aiming promote previously done posts but also an interactive stories with a voting option(“This or that”) to keep people engaged.</p>
          <p class="corp">Explain and justify the chosen channels/platforms used and show there is a solid connection to the objectives established in the Communication and Media Plan.</p>
		<p class="corp">Communication plan and Reach objectives:</p>
		<p class="corp">Our strategy is focused on effectively reaching our target audience and making them interact with our content, using Instagram and TikTok as primary platforms. The three core objectives are explained below: Reach, Affect and Response.</p> 
<p class="corp">Reach Objective</p>
<p class="corp">By April 11th, 2025 we aim to reach at least 1,000 unique views on TikTok, in order to increase our visibility among our target audience.</p>
<p class="corp">By April 11th, 2025 we aim to reach at least 300 unique accounts on Instagram, to boost brand awareness and engagement on the platform.</p> 
		<p class="corp">Affect Objective</p>
<p class="corp">By April 11th, 2025, we aim to evoke feelings of anticipation, belonging, connection, and engagement among our target audience (18–34 years old), encouraging them to feel inspired to attend theater performances, interact with our content, and feel drawn to explore our app, by posting relatable, engaging and community-driven content on Instagram and TikTok.</p> 
		<p class="corp">Response Objective</p>
<p class="corp">By April 11th, 2025, we aim to grow our Instagram presence by reaching at least 70 followers on our account, an average of 50 likes per post, a minimum of 10 comments per post and an average of 60 views per story.</p>
<p class="corp">By April 11th, 2025, we aim to grow our TikTok presence by reaching at least 100 followers on our account, an average of 60 likes per video, a minimum of 15 comments per video, and at least 1,000 total video views.</p>
		<p class="corp">Chosen channels</p>
		<p class="corp"> Our target group is younger theatre lovers. These theatre lovers are between 18 and 30 years old. They have the need to connect with others and they use the platforms: Instagram and TikTok.</p>
<p class="corp">One of the most widely used social media platforms among those aged 18 to 35 are TikTok and Instagram.</p> 
		<p class="corp">30.8% of Instagram’s users are between the ages of 18-24 and 30.3% of Instagram’s users are between the ages of 25-34 (Meeuwissen, 2025).</p> 
		<p class="corp">On TikTok 37.3% of TikTok users are between the ages of 18-24 and 32.9% of TikTok users are between the ages of 25-34 (Fingerspitz, 2024).</p> 
		<p class="corp">The target group uses this platform to stay in touch with each other, be aware of what's going on and find entertainment (Van Der Meijs, 2024).</p>
<p class="corp"> One of the most popular topics on TikTok are movies, series and music. As many as 52% of TikTok users are interested in these topics (Fingerspitz, 2024).</p>
<p class="corp">On Instagram generation Z users' main interests include fashion, beauty, wellness, finance, celebrities and lifestyle (Staff, 2024).</p>
<p class="corp">We used Instagram and TikTok as our primary channels because of their high engagement among our target audience. Our tone was informal, funny and relatable and reflected the vibe of Curtain Call itself.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="corp" style="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p class="corp">The campaign that we decided to follow was 4 weeks starting from the 17th of March till the 13th of April. In these four full weeks we pursued 8 post per week – 4 on Instagram and 4 on TikTok - every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday at a fixed posting timeslot. We couldn’t realize all of our planned posts due to technical issues; therefore, we ended up with:</p> 
		<p class="corp">12 posts on Instagram (7 of which reels)</p>
		<p class="corp">7 stories (one failed to upload)</p>
		<p class="corp">16 videos on TikTok.</p> 
		<p class="corp">So, did we reach our objectives?</p>
<p class="corp">We’ve managed to reach 506 accounts on Instagram and 14,715 unique views on TikTok. The information about TikTok was analyzed by a program (“Data Box”) which we connected to our account since we couldn’t find anywhere else the numbers for unique views.</p>
<p class="corp">We believe that we’ve managed to create anticipation and especially in TikTok we’ve built a stronger sense of community. Instagram was a challenge for us concerning creating engagement which was also confirmed by our analytics taking into account the response objective. We’ve managed to reach only 53 followers, a maximum of 18 likes per post (13 on average), with only 1 comment, and a maximum of 36 views per story (24 on average). Our TikTok account developed better, and we’ve managed to get ~7,400 views on our most popular video (~1120 on average), ~1120 likes on our most liked video (~96 on average), and a maximum of 3 comments per video.</p>
<p class="corp">To reflect on that, in Instagram, half of the views were generated by our followers and the other half by non-followers. The reels were most successful concerning views and interactions – between 150 and 300 views per reel, whereas our carrousel posts got between 50 and 100 views. The reels were the only type of content that reached our non-followers, and they generated more views than our followers. Our stories got around 25 views with no engagement since voting in a poll is not considered an engagement. We found out that getting users to follow the page and comment was really hard since we couldn't get any comments on our Instagram posts and we got only 52 followers.</p>
<p class="corp">Another finding was that the formats which attract interest could differ in TikTok and Instagram. For instance, our most liked video on Instagram got only 200 views on TikTok. The video explained the features of our product which made it more suitable for Instagram since people tend to search for meaningful content on this platform compared to TikTok. On the other hand, the video that got viral on TikTok also received the biggest amount on views on Instagram which proved that the sound and the way of filming were appreciated in both platforms. Even though the video was practically the same, what we’ve adapted was the text shown on both videos, so that each one has a distinctive goal and sends a unique message relevant for the two types of audiences.</p>
<p class="corp">In TikTok, according to the analytics, our traffic was mainly generated by the “For you” page. Our viewers were mainly females with more than the half of them being 18-24 years old which is also the target audience for our product and the biggest part of them being from the Netherlands (~35%). We found out also that our users were most active in the late hours of the day, mostly after 10pm which differed from the research we had done beforehand. What worked for us was recreating trending videos and using trending sounds as well as adjusting them to our brand. Our most trending video reached ~7,400 views and ~1120 likes, around 100 reposts, 3 comments and 43 saves. It was on a broader topic but still in the theater spectrum which caused a lot of engagement.</p>
<p class="corp">We found out that getting a lot of views comes easier than actually engaging the people or getting them to follow the account since we got approximately 1000 views on each video and around 30 likes per video. Also, some of the videos got max 300 views which we connected to posting in a different timeslot than the preplanned one.</p>
		<p class="corp">What went as expected and what didn’t?</p>
		<p class="corp">Week 1</p>
<p class="corp">We started off a bit messy. Not understanding the idea of a content calendar right, we had written down only the posting times and days including what type of post we have to create – reel, carousel, story. We didn’t have more concrete information on what exactly to post and therefore no captions. The planning for both platforms was on the same table. The team had to come up with ideas for each post on the spot, so it was quite chaotic, and the timeslots were not used properly. For this reason, our content in the first week was mainly comedy-based. There was an error with posting of our first story, so it ended up not uploading. The page gained around 15 followers in the first week since we were not promoting it a lot. We followed a few similar pages on Instagram to gain inspiration for content and branding. The reach objective for TikTok was fulfilled in the first week.</p>
		<p class="corp">Week 2</p>
<p class="corp">In the second week we’ve continued posting without a fixed schedule. Time slots were hardly followed again due to the fact that we were filming everything at the last moment. In TikTok we got our first video with a higher engagement – more than 50 likes and our first comment. There was misunderstanding in the team on who should post what so one of the TikToks was posted on a different timeslot which harmed the views a lot – it got only 200 views. In Instagram we’ve posted our first post with insights of our brand values, mission and vision also using a template with our colors and fonts.</p>
		<p class="corp">Week 3</p>
<p class="corp">For the third week we have already fixed our content calendar, so the planning was clearer and the ideas for each video were written down. By filling in the missing content in the schedule, we’ve created a strategy so that we present more information on the brand itself and mix it with more engaging videos which can be sent to a friend. We finally maintained a more defined style throughout our posts making use of the color palette, fonts and design. We were slowly getting a few more followers on both platforms. We’ve got also our most liked video on Instagram – 18 likes.</p>
		<p class="corp">Week 4</p>
<p class="corp">In the last week we’ve gathered the biggest part of our follows on both platforms. In Instagram they consisted mainly of friends. This was the week with our most successful video on TikTok. Thanks to that, the page got a few more follows. In Instagram we continued to advertise our app and posted a few more comedy-based videos with a trending sound. Only in the last week we’ve figured that our TikTok account was not a business one so we couldn’t get any analytics out of our previous posts. We’ve wrapped up the campaign successfully analyzing the flaws in our strategy and performance. </p>
		
		 <h4 id="marketing-3" class="corp" style="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p class="corp">For the future, it would be valuable to integrate a brand style that is present in all of our posts, especially in Instagram since people are really easily influenced by aesthetics. Furthermore, we would have to attract more followers by advertising the page on our personal profiles and following likewise pages and even connecting with them through a text-message. Posting more reels is also a way of attracting new theater-lovers since the content will appear on their feed. The Instagram stories could be also a good way of getting our followers to engage with our posts, therefore we should post more of them. </p> 
		<p class="corp">In TikTok we would continue using mainly faces in our videos since that works better for the attention span and also keep recreating trends and using trending sounds. What would help us with scheduling would be analyzing which times slots have worked best on TikTok so that we adapt our schedule to our target audience activity.</p>
<p class="corp">Planning better content is crucial for both platforms and choosing less people to take care of the social media profiles will enhance the performance so that the style of the brand is represented clearly and more consistently.</p> 
<p class="corp">When creating our new objectives we are taking into account the growth that we still have to achieve in order to reach and meet the old ones. Therefore, the expansion is bigger, concerning the goals that we have already accomplished in the first round, and respectively smaller in the areas we failed to reach.</p> 
		<p class="corp">Accordingly, our new goals would be:</p>
		<p class="corp">Reach Objective</p>
<p class="corp">By the 18th of May, 2025 we aim to reach at least 25,000 unique views on TikTok, in order to increase our visibility among our target audience.</p>
<p class="corp">By The 18th of May, 2025 we aim to reach at least 1000 unique accounts on Instagram, to boost brand awareness and engagement on the platform.</p>
		<p class="corp">Affect Objective</p>
<p class="corp">By the 18th of May, we aim to evoke feelings of belonging to our new community, and the need to connect with other members. We want to awaken loyalty in our new audience and a feeling of safety when communicating their needs and opinions on our platforms, showing engagement to the developed social media channels.</p>
		<p class="corp">Response Objective</p>
<p class="corp">By the 18th of May, 2025, we aim to grow our Instagram presence by reaching at least 150 followers on our account, an average of 70 likes per post, 20 comments per post and an average of 100 views per story.</p>
<p class="corp">By the 18th of May, 2025, we aim to grow our TikTok presence by reaching 130 followers on our account, an average of 150 likes per video, 25 comments per video, and at least 5,000 total video views. </p>

The first person proposes a theater date while the other person implies that there is only there for the other person and ends up answering with “goated”. This meme tried to replicate a similar meme format that had become very viral a few days prior, and we simply adapted it to a theater context to fit better with the theme and tone of voice of the brand. The audio used is “Wish” by Dipplo and Trippy Red which is a viral and fitting audio for this meme. </p>

          <p>Fill in at least 2 bullet points per building block and according to the rubrics.</p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We understood after the first problem interviews what the pains and difficulties were that theater lovers encounter when looking for plays. People struggle to find people to go to the theater with and they don’t get to share their passion as often. We just tried to simplify and focus on the main problematic points that ruin the experience for all the goers and improve that social aspect.</li>
            <li>Describe briefly how the problems are solved now (existing alternatives).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The app makes going to the theater more fun and social by encouraging exploration, simplifying social planning, and building trust and safety into every step of the experience. It allows the user to find plays in a more engaging way while it builds community through common chats in which people can plan meetings to go watch the plays together and discuss them afterwards. </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After all the interviews were done (first and second round), we built the profile based on the overall findings of the people that decided to answer and help us out. We understood that they are overall social people that enjoy attending this type of events and that have the means to afford them. Based on these people and results, we also made our ideal personas.  </li>
            <li>Describe briefly the characteristics of your ideal customer (early adopter, brand persona).</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We crafted the UVP after realizing that existing platforms don’t offer a social or emotionally engaging experience for theatergoers, but mostly for all kinds of events. Competitors such as “Eventix” or “Theatervoorstellingen” focus solely on the sale of tickets rather than a comfortable or informative website in which people can freely choose which plays they prefer. So that is what our app solves: a modernized look and a user friendly interface directed only by and for theater lovers. </li>
            
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Our unfair advantages came directly from what users didn't like about other platforms: outdated interfaces, no real community, and no way to interact. We designed features that are hard to replicate quickly: gamification by swiping, interest-based social groups, and a curated theater community built around conversation and reviews.  </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Channels</p>
          <ul>
            <li>As also used for the marketing plan, Instagram and TikTok are our main promotional channels. They are the ones in which our target group is the most active and allow us to tell stories, share events, and build hype. They're also ideal for launching targeted campaigns and growing a loyal user base. Similarly to some promotion in the theaters that we expect to collaborate with. The app store is our main distribution channel where people will be able to download and use the app once it is launched. </li>
          
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Key metrics</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The metrics we selected to measure growth include the number of app downloads, the number of plays liked/saved, active users in group chats, tickets purchased through the app and finally the social media insights to keep track of how the promotional content is working and how to improve it to reach the maximum amount of people for more interactions and more engaging chats. Each metric reflects how well we're solving user problems and creating a meaningful, repeatable experience </li>
           
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Revenue streams</p>
          <ul>
            <li>After testing ideas with users, we shifted from a subscription model to a one-time payment structure that they insisted felt more natural and acceptable for occasional users. This flexibility, along with affiliate ticket sales and optional in-app purchases, gives us multiple income paths without compromising user experience. The price was estimated based on how much the interviewees mentioned they would pay for the product. And for the number of users, as mentioned by Stimuler (2024), we can make a rough estimate of 15000 users in the first year depending on the platforms and channels we decide to launch and promote the product on. So 15000 premium users × avg €7 = €105,000 
			With ticketing affiliate deals = ~€10,000+.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Total ~€115,000 </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We built our cost estimates based on the essentials needed to launch and grow: development, hosting, and moderation. The goal was to keep fixed costs low while allowing for scalable marketing and support as the user base expands. Interviews helped us focus on features that truly matter, such as the play finding, the chats and an overall moderation to keep the spaces safe. This prevents unnecessary expenses. For the final ~35,000 in expenses, Glover (2024) helped us understand the cost of maintaining and hosting a server, while our moderation prices were based on previous research by Clutch.Co (2025). This was the proces to find the approximate price: €1500 x 12 server maintenance, 
€500 x 12 AI chat moderators, 
€1000 x 12 customer supports and safety, 
€500 advertisement. 
First-year estimate: ~€30,000–40,000 </li>
           
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The app was directly shaped by user input. Every feature from group chats to review systems was requested or validated in interviews such as the reviewing system, the group chats and the liked play window. This made sure the service matches not only our brand values but also the daily needs and habits of real theatergoers. </li>
            <li>Clarify the fit between the product/service developed and the brand identity/brand image.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>The insights gathered from our interviewees directly informed and shaped many elements of the Lean Canvas.  

Their feedback validated the core problem: theater lovers often miss out on shows due to a lack of company or accessible planning tools. Both users emphasized the importance of social connection, trust, and simplicity. These inputs lead us to pivot from a basic event-listing concept to a more community-driven platform with gamified discovery and interest-based group chats. Features like swipe interaction, saved likes, prior and post-event chats and review systems were all added or refined as a direct response to our test subject needs. The pricing model also evolved: initial ideas of a monthly subscription or free versions with ads were challenged by users’ preferences for one-time payments, prompting us to adapt toward a more fairly priced option.  

 <p class="corp">These conversations helped us go beyond assumptions and build a solution that aligns closely with real user behavior and emotional drivers, ensuring the business plan and value proposition are not only desirable but grounded in their actual demand. </p>
<p class="corp">This user-driven approach also influenced how we defined our target audience and ideal early adopters. Through patterns that emerged in the interviews, we identified young, culturally engaged individuals who often feel isolated in their interest in theater. Many of the people we talked to described themselves as open to meeting new people but hesitant to attend events alone; a pain point that highlighted the emotional need for a trusted community.</p>  

<p class="corp">This directly shaped our customer segments and guided the inclusion of features such as user profiles, interest-based filters, and safe chat environments, all designed to foster comfort and connection. </p>

<p class="corp">Furthermore, our choice of communication channels was justified by where these users already spend time. Both interviewees mentioned using platforms like Instagram and TikTok to discover events and connect with others, reinforcing our decision to focus marketing efforts on social media. </p> 

<p class="corp">Ultimately, the Lean Canvas evolved into a completer and more realistic model because we responded to the needs, behaviors, and preferences of real people.</p> </p>
