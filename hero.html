      <h3 class="title">Don't have anyone to go to the theatre with? Not a problem!</h3>
		 <p>Have you ever had a hard time finding friends that share your passion for theatre? Are you feeling silly watching another musical with your grandmother, because everyone else declined your invitation? An opportunity for change awaits!</p>
      <p>We created Curtain Call exactly for you. With a simple and familiar log in page you can start your community-building journey at any moment!</p>
		<h3 class="title">Step 1: Make an account!</h3>
		<p>Use your email to sign up for Curtain Call! Fill in the information you want us to know, although if you want to interact with our community often we might ask you to verify your identity with a simple ID-scan and a selfie clarification.</p>
		 <p>Set up your location and preferances. It doesn't matter whether you live in Amsterdam or Geldrop, our app is designed to find plays and events near you.</p>
		<p>Are you scared that we won't be able to cater your exquisite tastes? Trust us, we have a play for everyone! Musicals? Classic theatre? Modern theatre? Opera? You name it - we find it!</p>
		<p>Let other users know what you are into, write a short profile description that will attract potential friends!</p>

      <h3 class="title">Let's make finding plays a game!</h3>
      <p>There are so many dating and community making apps that use the "Tinder-formula" by allowing the user to swipe through different profiles to find their perfect match. What if we turn this concept around?</p>
		 <h3 class="title">Step 2: Swipe!</h3>
		<p>At Curtain Call we make you choose the play, not the audience! You will swipe through different plays to find out which one would suit your personal taste based on location, genre, price-range and popularity.</p>
		<p>Not only do we show the ratings of the plays on official websites, but we also let our users rate the plays they went to! Curtian Call guarantees honest reviews.</p>
		 <p>Interested in the play? Swipe right! Not interested - swipe left! It's just that simple.</p>
		<p>Under each play you can see all of the information you might need. Location, genre, content warnings, and the price.</p>
		<p>Once you found your perfect match you can either buy tickets for it, save it to check out later, or join the community of like-minded theatre-goers!</p>
		<h3 class="title">Step 3: Match!</h3>
		<p>Matched with a play? Congratulations, now it's saved on your profile. You can join the community if you want, or you can leave it to review later.</p>
		<p>Be careful, though, the tickets sell out fast!</p>

      <h3 class="title">Step 4: Build your own community!</h3>
      <p>What's better than sharing your thoughts with like-minded people and having a discussion about the things you love the most? </p> 
		<p>Use the app to interact with your group of people! Curtain Call can be just like any other social media, but better, because we specifically tailor content to your favourite play! </p> 
		<p>See what people think about it and share your opinion at the same time! Find people to have genuine conversations with. </p> 
		<p>Be assured, our communities care about what you love. Feel free to share all your thoughts and be responded to in kind by like-minded people, thanks to Curtain Call finding them for you.</p>
		<p>Meet up with people you get to know on the app to enjoy theatre together!</p>
		 <h3 class="title">Step 5: Enjoy your play!</h3>
		<p>Now that you've found new friends, bought your tickets and you've chatted with people who share the same interests, the rest is up to you!</p>
			<p>Go out! Find friends and experience your favourite plays!</p> 
		<p>All that's left for us to do is wish you a pleasant experience and a wonderful show.</p>
